## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative. Utilizing machine learning techniques, it processes textual reviews to predict customer sentiments, aiding restaurant owners in understanding customer feedback and enhancing service quality.

The project is structured as a Jupyter notebook, so users should run it **cell by cell** to follow the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps. Existing outputs in the notebook provide reference results for comparison and quicker understanding.

## Features

- Data Collection: Utilizes a dataset of restaurant reviews
- Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes review text
- Model Training: Applies machine learning algorithms to train sentiment classification models
- Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy metrics
- Visualization: Displays sentiment distribution and model results

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python 3.10
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk
- Modeling Techniques: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```python
git clone https://github.com/sameer-at-git/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```python
cd Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
```

3. Install required dependencies

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook: Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews.ipynb
2. Execute the cells **sequentially** to follow the analysis workflow.
   - Start with data loading and preprocessing
   - Continue with feature extraction and model training
   - Evaluate the models and visualize results
3. Users can compare their outputs with the existing outputs in the notebook to verify correctness.

## Notes

- The notebook is designed for learning and exploration.
- Users cannot simply run it as a script; sequential execution of cells is required.
- Existing visualizations and result tables provide guidance for understanding model performance.
